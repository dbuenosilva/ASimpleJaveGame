 * A "Room" represents one location in the scenery of the game.  It is 
 * connected to other rooms via exits.  The exits are labelled north, 
 * east, south, west, up and down.  For each direction, the room stores a reference
 * to the neighboring room, or null if there is no exit in that direction.
