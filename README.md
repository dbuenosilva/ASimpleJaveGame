COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by a new virus. Symptoms include fever, coughing, a sore throat and shortness of breath. The virus can spread from person to person, but good hygiene can prevent infection [1]. 
A group of scientists who developed the COVID-19 vaccine died in the building where they had worked for months. It is said that the COVID-19 vaccine and its formula are still in the building. However, due to the high risk of infection, nobody has gotten in the building to collect the vaccine yet. It is also known that there is some personal protective equipment (PPE) and is need some items to open the safe and to collect the vaccine.

To access the Vault room, to open the safe and to obtain the vaccine, the player needs to get the password in the IT room and the key in the Manager room. The player may pass for the Testing room and the Laboratory. However, if he/she access the Testing room or the downstairs Laboratory without wearing a mask, a glove and a protection glasses, he/she will die by COVID-19. In case the player does not access the Testing room and the downstairs Laboratory, he/she does not have to wearing PPE.
